# Prophet Challenge â€“ MercadoLibre

A project for school where I used Facebook Prophet to forecast hourly Google search trends for MercadoLibre, the biggest e-commerce platform in Latin America.

##  What This Project Does

- Analyzes hourly search traffic to find patterns
- Compares search traffic to stock price movements
- Builds a time series forecast using Prophet
- Breaks down seasonality by hour, day of week, and across the year
- Answers a few questions based on trend data

##  Tools Used

- Python
- pandas
- Prophet
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

##  Key Observations

- Search traffic peaks during the day, drops off overnight
- Tuesday is the most active day; Sunday is the lowest
- No strong correlation between search trends and stock volatility or returns
- Forecast suggests steady interest, no major spikes expected

## Notes

This was more about learning how to use Prophet than trying to get super accurate results. Still pretty interesting to see how search traffic flows over time.
